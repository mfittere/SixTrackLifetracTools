distribution: folder with input distribution from lifetrac
  + conversion scripts to sixtrack

----- Generation of distributions

1) get the normalization matrix
     cd mysimdir
     cp clean_input/*
     cp fort.3_da fort.3
     sixtrack # run the normal sixtrack version
   Commment:
   ---------
   To generate the distribution use fort.3_da which runs the 
   the 6D thin optics and returns the normalization matrix
   (tamatrix) in the fort.90 file and as a check in 
   NORM_IP1_DUMP_1
2) convert distribution to normalized coordinates
     mkdir dist_folder
     cp clean_input/distribution/*.py dist_folder
     cp fort.90 dist_folder/fort.90_da
     # modify distribution name in mk_col_dist.py
     # fn = 'mydist.dat'
     python mk_col_dist.py
     # -> generates two files:
     # mydist.dat_SI = SI units x [m] x'[m] y[m] y'[m] z[m] dE/E[1]
     # mydist.dat_Col = collimation block units x [m] x'[m] y[m] y'[m] z[mm] E[MeV]
   Comment:
   --------
   the SixTrack collimation version adds the closed
   orbit internally, thus the coordinates are
   explicitly given without the closed orbit
   in *_Col

----- Tracking with input distribution
1) copy distributions
     cp dist_folder/mydist.dat_Col
2) run sixtrack
     sixtrack # collimation version
3) plot phase space, make sure that IP1_DUMP_1 is generated:
     cp clean_input/distribution/plot_dist.py .
     cp clean_input/distribution/distribution_generator.py .
     cp dist_folder/fort.90 . # necessary to get normalization matrix and plot normalized phase space
     ipython
     %run plot_dist.py
